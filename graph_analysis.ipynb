To get started, you should make sure that you have a clear understanding of ordinary (i.e., non-personalized) page rank.  Read the description of page rank in Section 5.3 of [the course textbook](http://mapreduce.cc/).   Personalized page rank is like ordinary page rank except:\n",
    "- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node. Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n",
    "- Personalized page rank is initialized by assigning all probability mass to the source node, and none to the other nodes. In contrast, ordinary page rank is initialized by giving all nodes the same probability mass.\n",
    "- Whenever personalized page rank makes a random jump, it jumps back to the source node. In contrast, ordinary page rank may jump to any node.\n",

For each of the 10 nodes, return the node's id and page rank value as a tuple. The list returned by the function should therefore look something like this: `[(node_id_1, highest_pagerank_value), ..., (node_id_10, 10th_highest_pagerank_value)]`"

Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",

It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
